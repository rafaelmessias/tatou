0: tatou3d -- model?
1: [768] Tatou's palette
2: [64770] Tatou's image (Infogrames logo). Bytes 2 to 770 are its own palette (not sure what the first 2 bytes are). The funny thing is that file 1 in this PAK is also the Tatou's palette, but they are apparently different, but look the same...? I don't know.
3: [768] Main palette for the rest of the game.

3D Models:
- 2 bytes: flags
  - bit 2: on if the model has bones
  - bit 3: off if the model does not have bones (not sure about this one...?)
  - bit 4: some modifier for the bones (...?) if this is set, each bone has 24 bytes, else 16 bytes. It seems to indicate some extra rotation is necessary for the bone.
- 12 bytes: unknown
- 2 bytes: unknown offset; skip this before proceeding
- 2 bytes: num of points (aka numOfPoints, numPointInPoly)
- Points: numOfPoints * 3 * 2 (each point/vertex is 6 bytes: 2 bytes per each (X,Y,Z)
- If model has bones:
    - 2 bytes: num of bone offsets
    - Bone offsets: num of bone offsets * 2 (each bone offset is 2-bytes)
    - if bit 3 of flags is set, three angles are located at bytes 10, 12, and 14 after all the bone offsets are read.
      - It is unclear to me what happens if bit 3 is not set (not sure if this space is used or left empty)
    - A bone offset points forward in the file
    - Actual bone (starting at an offset):
      - 2 bytes: offset of starting vertex (from the vertex buffer)
      - 2 bytes: number of vertices
      - 2 bytes: parent vertex...? 
      - 1 byte: ...?
      - 1 byte: used as a check in computeBoneRotation (if 0 the rotation is not performed)
      - 2 bytes: type
      - 6 bytes: x, y and z of a translation (2 bytes each)
      - The type determines the translation. 
        - Type 1 is a normal translation.
        - Type 2 is a weird translation and I have no idea what it means.

...?

# Notes:
* The file "alonebody.cpp" describes how to load a model very succintly.

* It seems that spheres are actually never really fully drawn, but only circles.
